# This application is designed and implemented as semester project for the course CS-319.

## CS-319
Principles and stages of object-oriented software development. Overview of object-oriented software modeling with Unified Modeling Language and exposure to CASE tools for object-oriented development. Experience with such tools and environments through programming assignments and/or a term project.

## Oh My Goat 
Our project is basically a student club management app. Its primary goal is to put things in order and make it easier for us (students) and club executives. In this way, students will be able to obtain information about the clubs more easily. For example, students can join a club, view the events of a particular club, ask their questions about the club or any particular event on the respected forums. On the other hand, club executives and advisors will be able to get the attendance of events from this application, fill and check the necessary documentation on this application and forward it to an upper echelon. Also, managing club members involving accepting or kicking a member out of the club and many other club related work can be done by club executives. In short, we aim to digitalize the interactions that exist between a student and a club.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
