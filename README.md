## Oh My Goat 
Our project is basically a student club management app. Its primary goal is to put things in order and make it easier for us (students) and club executives. In this way, students will be able to obtain information about the clubs more easily. For example, students can join a club, view the events of a particular club, ask their questions about the club or any particular event on the respected forums. On the other hand, club executives and advisors will be able to get the attendance of events from this application, fill and check the necessary documentation on this application and forward it to an upper echelon. Also, managing club members involving accepting or kicking a member out of the club and many other club related work can be done by club executives. In short, we aim to digitalize the interactions that exist between a student and a club.
